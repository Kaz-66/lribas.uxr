                        <h3>Status of the Project WeResearch</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">At the start of the project, when WeResearch was funded, the core features—profile creation, search tool, matching algorithm, and coaching system—were already outlined, along with a growth roadmap.
                            <br/>The stakeholder's goal was to attract more investors, so my objective was to design the main pages of the site to present to them and lay the groundwork for the first Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
                            <br/>Initially, I had access to the project's presentation documents. Only a site mock-up existed, with design and content yet to be defined.</p>

                        <h3>Prototype Content</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The prototype content should closely resemble the MVP of the WeResearch site.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify"><b>To be functional, the site must allow users to create accounts, have profiles for both researchers and startups, and enable them to connect. Additionally, a landing page is needed to introduce the site to both users and investors.</b></p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Based on these requirements, I chose to design the following pages:</p>
                         <ul class="lead-bottom">
                            <li>The landing page</li>

                            <li>The profile page for researchers</li>
                            <li>The profile page for startup companies</li>
                            <li>The search tool</li>

                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">My work represents the initial stage of an iterative process, and there are several important next steps to consider. It would be advantageous for me to work on the different functions and pages of the MVP independently and later integrate them into a cohesive whole.</p> 
                         <h3>User Data Limitations</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">In constructing personas and defining user problems, my research was limited by time and the scope of my contacts. The data is skewed, with researchers making up about 70% of my sample, which introduces a bias, especially since my stakeholder is also a researcher. </p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">To refine my understanding, it would be valuable to conduct on-site interviews at startups collaborating with researchers. In-depth case studies, balanced with broader surveys, would help establish a more solid knowledge base.</p>
                         <h3>Explore Engine</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The current version of the explore engine is simple but sufficient for the MVP. The search system is straightforward, and no usability issues were identified during testing. However, it is crucial to verify whether the filters align with users' mental models and are effective in practice. These filters should ideally be refined based on user data from a Beta or Alpha release to better understand user behavior.</p>
                        <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">An interesting development idea came from a user testing participant, suggesting that users should be able to explore projects, not just profiles. Projects could be proposed by companies or researchers, which would add value and align with user needs, particularly for researchers.</p>
