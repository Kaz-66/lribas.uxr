                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The Plunet Product team decided to create a new dashboard (named “PlunetBoard”), taking advantage of modern technologies like REST API and Angular Material, and updating the old design. The project lasted several months and involved close teamwork between the design team, product owners, and both front-end and back-end developers. </p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">REST API technology allowed us to access a database that was previously out of reach. To make sure the new dashboard met users' needs, it was essential to determine what data they wanted to access and how they wanted it to be displayed. </p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">During the 2022 Plunet Conference, we organized a focus group with 22 participants. Alongside the design team, we hosted a workshop where participants discussed their ideas, suggested widgets they'd like to see, and 'liked' the ones they found most relevant. My main role was analyzing the data from this workshop.</p>

                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The results helped us clearly define the main themes for our users, such as Project Manager (PM) management and finance. Furthermore, it supported us to prioritize widget development based on their importance to users. See the example table below.</p>

                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">We created an initial MVP to test the technology and basic user flows. I performed the first round of usability tests to spot any early issues and confirm that basic user flows—like adding, removing, and organizing widgets—were working well. </p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I ran a series of moderated usability tests with five participants to uncover usability issues. After each test, participants completed a standard SUS questionnaire, giving us a validation score and a way to track usability improvements over time.</p>
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The results showed the interface is intuitive, with an A+ SUS score, and helped identify some early usability issues. You can see a sample of the results in the table below. </p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">One of the main features of the new dashboard is the ability to filter data based on user needs. A key filter across many use cases is the time filter, which lets users sort projects by creation date, due date, etc. This posed two challenges: understanding what users need from time filters and how to display these filters intuitively.</p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">We worked in two stages with the design team. First, we sent out a survey to understand user needs (31 responses), asking users to rank their interest in different time filters. Then, we held a design workshop to explore various design possibilities. Below is an example showing two different design approaches.</p>
                         <img src="Images/drafttimefilter.png" class="image-centred rounded-3">
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The survey was crucial in revealing that users are most interested in short-term filters, and that hour-based filtering are crucial for a significant part of them. You can find two illustrations of these results below.</p>
                         <img src="Images/timefilterresults.png" class="image-centred image-bw-text">
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">We opted for a compact dropdown design with limited advanced customization to keep the screen uncluttered, given the filter system’s complexity.</p>
