                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Plunet GmbH sells a flexible and customizable SaaS software (Plunet BusinessManager - PBM) with a complex interface. Ensuring PBM's usability is important because it helps industry professionals complete tasks more quickly and securely. Until this project, there hadn't been a centralized way to measure PBM's usability—only feedback from specific projects was available. </p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The goal of this project is to create an overall usability measure for PBM, so we can benchmark and monitor its usability over time. To get a complete view of PBM's usability, we conducted parallel research focusing on two aspects of usability: accessibility and responsiveness.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom fst-italic text-justify">Please note that, due to data protection concerns, the data has been modified.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Measuring PBM's usability faces two main obstacles. The first is that the software doesn't allow for tracking behavioral data. The second is that the software is so flexible and customizable that user experiences can vary widely. <br /> What method would enable us to overcome these two obstacles, and provide a valid and reliable measurement to the product team? </p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I started by facilitating a workshop with the product team to clarify their needs and what usability measurement could offer. This workshop helped us define the metric's goals, the desired frequency of use, and the acceptable margin of error.</p>
                         <img src="Images/Frame 290.png" class="mb-3 image-centred rounded-3">
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Considering the team's needs and the software's limitations, I decided that the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) was the best choice. This questionnaire focuses on overall user experience and is broad enough to cover multiple aspects of usability.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I then set up the survey and distributed it twice, four months apart. The first survey had 39 participants, and the second had 49, with 15 users participating in both rounds.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">By repeating the survey, I could test the stability of the results over time (since no major changes were made to the interface in four months) and conduct reliability and validity tests. These tests confirmed the quality of the results and validity of the method.</p>
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom">This study showed us PBM's usability level and how it compares to market standards. Based on this method. we established a bi-annual measurement to monitor PBM usability over time.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Usability involves considering alternative ways of using the product, such as when it's used by individuals with limited abilities (accessibility) or on alternative interfaces like smartphones (responsiveness). However, these topics can have a big impact on design development if they are taken into account. <br />To ensure that enlightened decisions are taken in this regard, I undertook a research project to determine user needs and product usage.</p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The process was the same for both accessibility and responsiveness. I conducted two surveys for each topic—one internal survey with teams that interact with users, and one external survey with the users themselves. This approach provided a larger dataset and helped to cross-check the different perspectives. The results were then used as the basis for a workshop to make decisions on these subjects.</p>
                         <img src="Images/image 9.png" class="image-centred">
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The workshop emphasized the importance of accessibility and responsiveness, and their potential impact on the design process. A significant design decision was made: design elements based on the Angular Material frontend library will no longer be customized. This aims to streamline the work of front-end developers while making it easier to create accessible and responsive interfaces. </p>
